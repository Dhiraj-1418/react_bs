# React + Bootstrap Simple Project

Welcome to my first project integrating **React** with **Bootstrap**! 🚀  
This project is a part of my learning journey as I work towards becoming a **Full Stack Developer**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This is a basic React application that demonstrates how to effectively use **Bootstrap** to build responsive, styled UI components within a React environment. It's designed to showcase clean code, component structure, and reusable design elements.

## 🛠️ Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) – Popular CSS framework for responsive design
